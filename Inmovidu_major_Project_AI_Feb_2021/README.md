Hello every one , this is my first machine learning project. 
There are three files in this folder as you can see.
The files named as
1. Inmovidu_Major_Project_Final.pdf
2. Inmovidu_Major_Project_Sankalp_Singh_Bais 

The notebook above contains the complete code which i submitted to the my training programme, the pdf file is report for the same.
For this project i tried to create my very own model as first. but that dint work and it gave very bad accuracy at that time around 38% (ofcourse it changes evfery time you retrain the model), so i used resnet34 model with accuracy around 90% so that i can submit the project on time.

Later when i got time i worked on my custom model more and created the copy of the main notebook thats the 2nd notebook 
Inmovidu_Major_Project_Final_Copy.ipynb 
This time my model showed accuracy of around 72% which is huge leap from the last 38%.
I have tried to explain most of the thing in the notbook itself. so check that out.
Thankyou
